Automatic "sticky" manager for multimonitor workspaces.

Background:
    I have a three-monitor setup, and on one monitor I generally like to keep
everything sticky; that is, the window appears regardless of which workspace I
am currently on.  Not wanting to give up xfwm4 for something like Xmonad that
reportedly has the feature built-in, I made a quick shell script that runs in
the background and assigns sticky bits.

Features:
  - Polls every x seconds (default: 2) for windows
  - Windows that are now farther right than a threshold will be marked sticky
  - Windows that were marked sticky that got unmarked (by the user) will not be
    touched again
  - Moving the window to the left of the threshold will revert the sticky state

Prerequisites:
  - wmctrl
  - A EWMH/NetWM compatible window manager (many are)

Setup:
 1. Modify the sleep line to set the amount of time between polls. 2 seconds is
    probably a good balance between responsiveness and processing.
 2. Change "-ge 3200" to match your setup. Set the 3200 to the x-pixel offset
    and change -ge to -le if you want to make the sticky are to the left. You
    can also add conditions based on $y if you want vertical location to be a
    factor.

Usage:
 1. Just run autosticky. You'll probably want it to be run on startup.
 2. Drag a window past the threshold and you should see it turn sticky.
 3. Drag the window back before the threshold and it should revert.
